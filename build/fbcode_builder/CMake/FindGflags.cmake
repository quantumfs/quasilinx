# Copyright (c) Quantumfs.
# Find libgflags.
# There's a lot of compatibility cruft going on in here, both
# to deal with changes across the FB consumers of this and also
# to deal with variances in behavior of cmake itself.
#
# Since this file is named FindGflags.cmake the cmake convention
# is for the module to export both GFLAGS_FOUND and Gflags_FOUND.
# The convention expected by consumers is that we export the
# following variables, even though these do not match the cmake
# conventions:
#
#  LIBGFLAGS_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find gflags/gflags.h, etc.
#  LIBGFLAGS_LIBRARY     - List of libraries when using libgflags.
#  LIBGFLAGS_FOUND       - True if libgflags found.
#
# We need to be able to locate gflags both from an installed
# cmake config file and just from the raw headers and libs, so
# test for the former and then the latter, and then stick
# the results together and export them into the variables
# listed above.
#
# For forwards compatibility, we export the following variables:
#
#  gflags_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find gflags/gflags.h, etc.
#  gflags_TARGET / GFLAGS_TARGET / gflags_LIBRARIES
#                     - List of libraries when using libgflags.
#  gflags_FOUND       - True if libgflags found.
#
